// **A declared duration must sit BELOW the decoded length, and an exact one does not.** The engine
// posts a slot's track again when the voice ends while that slot is still current, so a duration at
// or above the real length loses that race about half the time: the row holds a 32-bit float whose
// step is 15 microseconds at three minutes, and the rounding decides the sign. Measured on two
// tracks four microseconds either side of their own length - the one rounded up played twice, the
// one rounded down played once.
//
// A station that under-declares does not run the race at all: the slot ends first and the engine
// waits for the voice, so the margin costs no audio. Vanilla is built that way, and by far more -
// `mus_radio_12_afterlife` declares 166 s for 169.7 s.
//
// **What caps the margin is that the station clock free-runs.** A slot shorter than its track
// advances the clock a little further than one slot per post, and the excess accumulates until a
// slot is passed over and its track goes unplayed. Half a second is 33,000 times the float step and
// reaches that point about once in 450 tracks.

// **A station's level belongs on its send, not in its samples**, so a track registered against this
// framework's own type is handed to AudioXL untouched. The game's `mod_sfx_radio` object has no send
// this framework can set, and its own reaches a world device 3 to 7 dB hotter than any vanilla
// station, so a full-scale sample wraps there. This is the trim that path needs, measured: -5 dB
// lands both of its sends inside the vanilla range.
//
// It MULTIPLIES the station's and the track's own gains rather than replacing them, so a manifest
// that asks for a level gets the same relative result whichever type carries the sound.

// **Every label the game shows is a localization KEY, never the text.** The name table the plugin
// patches holds one, and so does every audioRadioTrack. A station's key is minted here and the text
// registered against it, so the UI resolves a custom station exactly as it resolves a vanilla one.
// Raw text in those slots is what makes a label vanish and the station selector match nothing.
