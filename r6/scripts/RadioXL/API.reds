// Mod Name: RadioXL
// Author: Spuddeh
// Description: The script API a RadioXL 0.1.0 station mod calls.
// File Version: 0.4.1
// ======================================================================================
//
// A station built for RadioXL 0.1.0 registers itself with one call from its own script. That call
// has to exist, or the station mod fails script validation and takes every redscript mod on the
// machine down with it. Adopting such a station outright - reading its record and its AudioXL
// rows as a manifest - is issue #10; until then the call is answered and logged, and the station
// is not created.
