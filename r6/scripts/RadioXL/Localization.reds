// A row inserted into onscreens.json as it loads resolves by numeric hash, which is how a song title
// is looked up, and does not resolve by key STRING, which is how `GetLocalizedTextByKey` and
// `inkText.SetLocalizedTextString` look a station name up - the dashboard and every world device.
// Codeware merges provider text at the engine's own text-loading hook, and text registered there
// resolves both ways. The keys are the same ones the plugin mints, so the two routes agree.

module RadioXL

// Codeware is a hard dependency of the framework (the callback system, the resource depot,
// ScriptableService), so this import is unconditional.

// One of the panel's own strings, by key. Reads go through Codeware's LocalizationSystem, which
// is where a ModLocalizationProvider's texts live; the game's GetLocalizedText does not see
// them. A missing key renders as the key, so a fault names itself on screen.
