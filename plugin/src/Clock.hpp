// Mod Name: RadioXL
// Author: Spuddeh
// Description: The engine's own station clock, handed to AudioXL as each track's start offset.
// File Version: 0.3.0
// Credits: AudioXL by DigitalVixen.
// ======================================================================================
//
// **The engine works out where a vanilla station is in its song and seeks there; on the custom-sound
// path it hands the renderer 0.** So a custom station tuned back to would restart its track. Every
// station object carries a clock (+0x14c) that counts seconds since its current slot began, whether
// or not anyone is listening, on engine time rather than sim time. This reads that clock a few times
// a second for every custom station, asks the engine which track the station is on, and arms that
// track's row in AudioXL with the clock as the start of its next voice (`PlayFrom`). The engine's
// next post of the row, from a tune-in or a receiver toggle, starts where the station is.
//
// **This runs from the plugin's own game-state update, not from a script timer.** A script delay
// callback stops with sim time, and the station selector on foot stops sim time while it is open,
// so a station picked from an open selector posted with nothing armed and started from 0.
// The game-state update runs whenever the game does.
//
// The walk reads engine memory by offset, so it is wrapped in SEH like the probe it came from: a bad
// read disables the clock and says so, and the game carries on with tracks starting from 0.
