# The station set and load order

A station is a live object in a container, built once by the engine while the audio metadata loads,
from three things that must all be present at that moment. Two out of three plays nothing. One
combination kills every radio in the game. Anything that arrives after the moment is ignored, with
nothing in any log.

## What a station needs

| | Where it lives | Who supplies it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Identity** | its `CName` in the compiled roster ([roster page](compiled-station-roster.md)) | the plugin, at load |
| **Membership** | its name in `audioRadioStationMetadataMap.radioStations`, an `array:CName` in `cooked_metadata.audio_metadata` | script, as that resource loads |
| **Content** | an `audioRadioStationMetadata` entry: `name`, `tracks` (event `CName`s), `speaker`, `blips` | script, as that resource loads |

The shipped map `radio_stations_config` names sixteen stations, and **position in that array is the
station's UI index**: `RadioStation.MinimTech` carries `index: 5` and `radioStations[5]` is
`radio_station_06_minim_techno`. Police and kurtz sit at 14 and 15 with no `RadioStation` record.

## What kills every radio

`[M]` Nine variants, one changed thing each, against a working baseline:

| Map change | Metadata entry | Route | Radios |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none | none | - | work |
| none | added | script | work |
| append a name | none | archive | work |
| replace slot 15 (kurtz) | none | archive | work |
| replace slot 5 with a name the engine knows | - | archive | work, the displaced station silent |
| append a name | **added** | archive + script | **dead** |
| replace slot 15 | **added** | archive + script | **dead** |
| replace slot 5, new identity | added | archive + script | **dead** |
| any write to `radioStations` from script | - | script | **dead** (before the roster patch) |

**The mechanism.** The engine walks `radioStations` and looks each name up among the metadata
entries. A name with no entry is skipped and costs nothing. A name **with** an entry is a station to
construct, and construction fails for an identity that is not in the compiled roster. That failure
takes the whole radio subsystem down - Radioport and world devices alike, silently. **Half a station
is ignored; a whole one is fatal.** Extend the roster first and the same combination works.

`[M]` `GetRadioStationCurrentTrackName(CName)` reads a container off a global singleton at
`0x342ac00` and returns the `NoneTrack` CName when the lookup misses. A station is an object in that
container, not a row in a table. Every station runs continuously on one clock, so a real station
answers whether or not a receiver is tuned to it.

## The window is the resource load

`[M]` **Membership and the entry must be in place while `cooked_metadata.audio_metadata` is
loading.** Register them a few seconds later and the data is present, every log line reads as
success, and the station is silent on every receiver:

```
19:28:22  registered radio_station_20_tool: 11 track(s)   -> plays on all three receivers
20:14:15  registered radio_station_20_tool: 11 track(s)   -> silent on all three
```

Same code, same data. Only the timing moved.

`Resource/Load` (Codeware's callback system) fires while a resource is loading, before the engine
consumes it, and that is the window. It does not fire for a resource another mod already pulled in,
so the framework also asks the depot for a token and makes every write safe to run twice.

The same holds for `eventsmetadata.json`: an event must have a row there to be posted by name, and
the row's `minDuration`/`maxDuration` is what the station schedules the next track against. `[I]`
The engine reads those durations when it builds the station, not at play time: a station built while
its rows were absent picked a track at random on every tune-in even though the rows arrived, with
correct durations, minutes before anyone listened.

## Durations, and where they can come from

`[M]` **A station built against zero durations picks a track at random each time it is selected.**
With real durations it picks the track the world clock says. Vanilla trims one to eight seconds off
several tracks and declares the trimmed length; a declared length longer than the audible one makes
the station wait out the silence.

**AudioXL cannot supply the length in time.** Its `Duration()` is frames over sample rate read from
the engine's custom-sound row table. That row exists only after the engine's audio system
initialises (AudioXL's `AudioInit` hook flushes a queue of registrations then) and the file has been
decoded. Both come seconds after the metadata loads. So:

| Register early | Register late |
| --- | --- |
| the station plays | the station is never constructed |
| durations are 0, random track each time | durations right, nothing plays |

The framework reads the length from the audio file's own headers at plugin load instead
(`plugin/src/Duration.hpp`), before any script runs:

| Format | Read |
| --- | --- |
| MP3 | ID3v2 skipped; the Xing/Info or VBRI frame count when present, else a walk of every frame header |
| FLAC | STREAMINFO total samples over sample rate |
| Ogg Vorbis | identification header rate, last page's granule position |
| WAV | `data` chunk size over `fmt` byte rate |

`[M]` Against ffprobe on eleven album tracks and six synthetic files: every MP3 within one frame
(26 ms), FLAC, Ogg and WAV exact, eleven files in 70 ms. A track whose length cannot be read is
dropped at manifest load and named in the log, rather than registered against zero.

## Order of operations, as shipped

```
plugin load      identity (roster), label key (name table), every track's length
eventsmetadata   one row per track, with that length            <- while it loads
cooked_metadata  membership, the station entry, a title row per track   <- while it loads
onscreens        the station name and every title              <- while it loads
TweakDB apply    RadioStation and UIIcon records
whenever ready   AudioXL registration of each file
```

Only the last step may wait. The engine resolves the sound at play time, so a row that appears
seconds later still plays; a station that appears seconds later never exists.

## Other things measured on the way

- `speaker` is `audioRadioSpeakerType`: Stanley 0, MaximumMike 1, PoliceDispatch 2, Kurtz 3, Ash 4,
  None 5. Twelve vanilla stations are Stanley. **`None` plays** - a station ran without a DJ for the
  whole of development. The manifest's `news` chooses between `Stanley` and `None`.
- `radio_station` and `radio_port_station` are **not Wwise switch groups**. Neither appears in
  `init.bnk`'s `STMG` chunk and no object in the radio banks references their ids. Both are handled by
  the game's own audio layer, and one handler at `0x9d9c6c` serves both, calling the roster resolver
  and parking the requested station at `+0x110` of a state object with a dirty flag.
- **`RequestSongOnRadioStation(CName station, CName song)`** on the audio system works from script:
  it forces a registered song onto a named station on demand.
- `audioPlaylistEmitterMetadata` / `audioPlaylistMetadata` (157 and 53 entries) are a second audio
  path for world emitters with numbered broadcast channels - clubs, markets, the Phantom Liberty
  hangout. A world device radio does not use it; it goes through the roster like the Radioport.
